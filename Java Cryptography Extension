Finding maximum possible key length
To find maximum key length allowed by an encryption algorithm you can useCipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength() method.  For example for AES algorithm you can do - 

int maxKeyLength = Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength("AES");


Removing the maximum key size restriction
Download local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar extracted from above zip file to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security 
Note: These jars will be already be present there so you will have to overwrite them.
